# Provisioning VPC, ECS, EFS, and ALB using Terraform


This is the example of creating an open source infrastructure using Terraform and AWS cloud provider. It consists of:
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with 3 public subnets in 3 availability zones
- Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Elastic File System (EFS)


Some guidelines:
An overview can be found on Youtube of the above infrastructure [here](https://youtu.be/Ky7sph6fBtM?t=881)
We host everything in us-east-1 until funding can have global replicas
We automate everything where possible

## Prerequisites
Download and Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
Create SSH Keys in AWS (pem files to access servers)
Install Terraform
Install the AWS CLI
Create appropriate roles to access AWS resources
## How to create the infrastructure?
This example implies that you have already AWS account and [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) installed.
1. `git clone https://github.com/NonaSoftware/terraform_ecs_infrastructure.git`
2. `cd terraform_ecs_infrastructure`
3. `terraform init`
4. `terraform plan`
5. `terraform apply`

Note: it can take about 5 minutes to provision all resources.
## How to delete the infrastructure?
1. Terminate instances
2. Run `terraform destroy`

## Brief Description

Cluster is created using container instances (EC2 launch type, not Fargate!). 

In this example, verified module `vpc` is imported from Terraform Registry, other resources are created in relevant files.

In file `ecs.tf` we create:
  - cluster of container instances _web-cluster_
  - capacity provider, which is basically AWS Autoscaling group for EC2 instances. In this example managed scaling is enabled, Amazon ECS manages the scale-in and scale-out actions of the Auto Scaling group used when creating the capacity provider. I set target capacity to 85%, which will result in the Amazon EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group being utilized for 85% and any instances not running any tasks will be scaled in.
  - task definition with family _web-family_, volume and container definition is defined in the file container-def.json
  - service _web-service_, desired count is set to 10, which means there are 10 tasks will be running simultaneously on your cluster. There are two service scheduler strategies available: REPLICA and DAEMON, in this example REPLICA is used. Application load balancer is attached to this service, so the traffic can be distributed between those tasks.
  Note: The _binpack_ task placement strategy is used, which places tasks on available instances that have the least available amount of the cpu (specified with the field parameter). 

In file `asg.tf` we create:
  - launch configuration
  - key pair
  - security groups for EC2 instances
  - auto-scaling group. 

Note: in order to enable ECS managed scaling you need to enable `protect from scale in` from auto-scaling group.

In file `iam.tf` we create roles, which will help us to associate EC2 instances to clusters, and other tasks.

In file `alb.tf` we create Application Load Balancer with target groups, security group and listener. 

In file `s3.tf` we create some buckets that are needed by applications. The terraform state bucket is in the `main.tf` file.


In file `db.tf` we create redis and other database applications
